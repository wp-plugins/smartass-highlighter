== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which programming languages are supported? =

It supports all programming languages. No need to mention the language of the code anywhere

= I don't like the style and theme colors of this plugin. How to change the colors? =

Edit the file *highlighter.css* to change the colors. See the documentation of CSS and class details at [Google Code Prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/source/browse/trunk/src/prettify.css "Prettify.css")

= Will this highlighter make my webpage slow? =

SmartAss Highlighter uses two files in output- `highlighter.js` and `highlighter.css`. These two files have total size of 17KB but If you web server supports [compression](http://justtechthings.com/2A1KS "How to compress web content") then the reduced load will be of 7KB. However, If your server does not support compression or you dont have control over it, please visit [plugin page](http://justtechthings.com/SmartAss-Highlighter/ "plugin page").

= What is different about this highlighter? =

* It uses a shortcode to trigger, so user can control highlighting from post to post.
* The extra code/libraries are added in footer, so that you page is loaded first and highlighting is done later *asynchronously*
* No option menu
